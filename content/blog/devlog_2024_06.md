## More Pathfinding (again)



### Propagating Line-of-sight through Portals

As described in our [April devlog](TODO), the pathfinder uses line-of-sight (LOS) optimization
to improve pathing close to the target cell. To put it simply: When a cell on the grid is flagged as LOS,
there exist a direct (non-obstructed) path from this cell to the target. In practice, this
means that any game entity at the position of this cell can move to the target position in
a straight line. This makes pathing look much more natural and *smooth*. If we would
only use the direction vectors of the flow field right until the end, we would
be limited to their 8 possible directions.

In our initial implementation, LOS optimization was confined to the target sector, i.e.
cells outside the target sector were never flagged as LOS. However, this meant that a lot
of paths that could have been a straight line but crossed a sector boundary looked
noticeably weird. Instead of bee-lining straight towards the target when there are
no obstructions, game entities would have to move to the edge of the target sector first
before they would reach an LOS cell:

*You can almost see where the sector boundary is as the game entity is turning very sharply towards the target as it reaches the first LOS flagged cell in the target sector.*

This behaviour has been fixed by propagating the LOS integration through sector portals.
Essentially, LOS flags are passed from one side of the portal (in the entry sector) to the
other (in the exit sector). LOS integration then continues in the exit sector using the passed LOS flagged
cells as the starting point. As a result, paths look much better when they cross multiple sectors:

### Optimizing Field Generation

The topic of performance came up in a Reddit comment before, so we thought it might be interesting to pick it up
again. Performance is big factor in the feasibility of flow fields, since pathfinding should not
stall gameplay operations. Flow fields do have some benefits for the quality of paths, but the added
complexity can come with a hefty performance price tag. Thus, we have to ensure that the pathfinding
is still as performant as possible.

Over the last month, we have applied several optimization strategies:

**Simplified Code**

We removed a lot of redundant code from the design phase of the pathfinder. This includes things
like redundant sanity checks, debug code, or flags that were only relevant for the pathfinding
demos that you've seen in our monthly devlogs.

**CPU-friendly datastructures**

To increase throughput for field generation on the CPU, we replaced most occurences of datastructures
that are known to be slow (e.g. `std::unordered_map`, `std::deque`, `std::unordered_set`) with
vectorized data types (`std::vector` and `std::array`). These data types utilize the CPU's L1-L3 caches
much better, which means that the CPU has to spend less time on fetching data from RAM and has more
time for running calculations.

**Flow Field Caching**

Generated flow fields are now cached and reused for subsequent path requests if possible.
In practice, chaching can be done for all flow fields on the high-level path where the target
is a portal cell (i.e. any sector that is not the target sector). Since field
generation is deterministic, building two flow fields with the same target cell results
in them being equal. Therefore, if a high-level paths uses the same portal as a previous
path request, the previously generated flow field can be reused.

----

The overall result of our optimizations is that pathfinding is now about 2x-4x faster than
in our first iteration. Technically, there are no benchmarks yet, so you have to trust our numbers
for now. On our test machines, a path request can take between `0.3ms` and `2ms` for paths
of roughly the same length, depending on the number of fields that have to be built and
how many obtructions there are per sector. Flow field and integration field generation
in the low-level pathfinding stage is now so fast that the A\* calculations of the
high-level pathfinder are becoming the bottleneck with ~50% runtime usage.

## Frustum Culling

- contribution by an external contributor
  - optimization for the renderer
  - frustum culling: only render objects that are in view of the camera
    - e.g. 200 objects in view vs. 10000 on map
    - that's a lot of objects that can potentially be skipped

- implementation:
  - get frustum from camera
    - imagine it as a box with one side being the game window
    - extending into the scene displayed by the renderer
  - for each rendered object, check if its position is in the box
  - if it's not in the box, don't render it


## What's next?

That was definitely enough pathfinding for a while. There is a probably still lot to improve,
but other parts of the engine need attention too.

Next month, we will focus more on game entity *interactions*. That means we will make them do
things to each other, like damage or healing or whatever we can think about that's fun (and
not too complicated).
