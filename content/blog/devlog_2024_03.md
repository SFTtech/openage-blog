Summary: Devlog for February/March 2024

Hello everyone and welcome to another round of openage updates. If you enjoyed the pathfinding
explanations from our last devlog, you can probably start getting excited because this month's
post will be *all about* even more fun pathfinding features. However, we hope that those of
you who are not avid pathfinding aficionados can have some fun too. So let's get to it.


## Line of Sight Optimization

In [last month's update]({filename}/blog/devlog_2024_01.md), we showed off the flow fields that
are created by our new pathfinder implementation. Essentially, the idea behind flow fields is
that instead of computing a single path from start A to target B, we generate a vector field
for the whole grid where every cell gets assigned a vector that points towards the next cheapest
cell for reaching B. As a result, units anywhere on the grid can follow (or *flow*) along these vectors to
eventually arrive at the target (see below).

![Flow field example]({static}/images/news/2024-03/flow_field_example.png)

*target cell == (7,7); origin is left corner*

- *yellow == less expensive*
- *purple == more expensive*
- *black == impassible*

In this example, you can see that the flow field vectors only support 8 directions. A side
effect of this is that paths become diamond-shaped, i.e. they have turns of at least 45 degrees.
While this may not be as noticeable when you are just looking at the static flow field, it can be very annoying
when observing units in motion. When controlling units, most players would expect them to go in a straight line
if there are no obstacles between start and target (and not take detour into a castle's line of fire).
For this reason, we have to do some low-level optimization that smoothes out short-distance
paths in these situations.

One of these optimizations is a so-called *line-of-sight pass*. In this preliminary step,
we flag every cell that can be reached from the target in a straight line with an "line-of-sight" flag.
Units in these cells can then be pathed directly towards the target in a straight line
without having to use the vector field. You can see the results of doing such a line-of-sight
pass in the image below.

![Line-of-sight pass]({static}/images/news/2024-03/los_pass_demo.png)

*target cell == (1,4); origin is left corner*

- *white == line-of-sight flag*
- *light grey == blocked flag*
- *dark grey == passable, but no line-of-sight*
- *black == impassible*

Impassable cells or cells with more than minimum cost are considered line-of-sight *blockers*
and are assigned a separate "blocked" flag. The same goes for cells that are only partially
in line-of-sight, e.g. cells that are on the line between the blocker cells' outer corners
and the edge of the grid. The cells marked as "blocked" form the boundaries of a line-of-sight
vision cones that span across the grid.

For cells with a "line-of-sight" flag, we can skip calculating flow field vectors as they are
no longer necessary for finding a path.


## Travelling with Portals

One advantage of flow fields is that the generated field may be reused for multiple
path requests to the same target, e.g. group movement of units. While reusing the fields
can save computation time in this context, the complexity of flow field calculations
make the initial cost of building the flow field much higher than for other pathfinding
methods. On larger grids, this can make individual path requests incredibly slow.

To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple trick: We split the pathfinding grid
into smaller *sectors*, e.g. with size 16x16, and search for a high-level path through
these sectors first. Afterwards, we only calculate flow fields for the sectors
that are visited and ignore the rest of the grid.

To accomplish this, sectors are connected via so-called *portals*. Portal are created on
the pathable edges between two sectors. Additionally, portals in the same sector are connected
to each other if they are mutually reachable. The result is a mesh of portal nodes that can be
searched with a high-level pathfinder. For the high-level pathfinder, we can use a node-based approach
intead of flow fields, e.g. the A* algorithm, to search the mesh. Finding the high-level path
should usually be pretty fast as it only depends on the number of portals on the grid.

- *grey == portal tiles*
- *black == impassible*


## What's next?

The only major step left in the pathfinder integration is to include it into the actual game simulation, i.e.
building it into map/terrain generation. This should be easier than the implementation the pathfinder itself,
but will take some effort to get right. If pathfinding becomes too tedious, we might switch
things up and work on something else for a short while. In any case, you will find out what
we decided to do in next month's update!
