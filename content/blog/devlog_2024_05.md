Summary: Devlog for May 2024

- Pathfinding into game simulation
- took a bunch of smaller changes and tweaks

## Pathfinding in Game Simulation

- Flow field pathfinding in simulation with result:

![]()

- Pathfinder is initialized during terrain generation using modpack data
  - as discussed in last month's post
  - for the terrain, create matching pathfinding grids
  - one grid for each nyan path type
- Movement system now uses the pathfinder
  - submit a path request from game entity's current position to target position
  - using correct grid associated with the move ability
  - simple abstraction
  - pathfinder returns waypoints
  - only thing left for the movement system to do is to handle waypoints

- however: to get this to work properly, we had to fix a bunch small issues
  - we will quickly go through them now

### Blocking Diagonal Paths

When we compute the direction vector of a cell in a flow field, we want it to point
in the direction of the neighbor cell with the lowest path cost. In our initial implementation,
we just iterate through all 8 neighbor cells in any order (e.g. clock-wise) to find the
cell with the minimum cost value and set the direction vector accordingly.

However, this solution does not account for a specific edge case that affects diagonal movement.
You can probably easily pot it by looking at the example grid below.

![Naive cell comparison]()

For a diagonal path to exist, either of its horizontal and vertical neighbor cells must
also be passable. If both are impassable, most RTS (including AoE2) block diagonal
movement in the corresponding direction. This means that just comparing the cost of
all 8 neighbor cells is not enough. We also have to check the additional constraints
or the diagional directions.

The solution to this problem is actually pretty simple. Essentially, we split the comparison
of the 8 neighbor cells into two phases. In the first phase we only compare the horizontal and
vertical neighbors of the cell (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST). Additionally, we check whether these
cells are passable and if so, set a corresponding flag in a bitfield. In the second phase,
we compare the diagonal neighbors of the cell (NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST). In
addition to comparing the cost, we also determine if the diagonal route is not blocked by its
vertical and horizontal neighbors by checking if the corresponding bits in the bitield are set.
For example, for using the NORTHEAST direction, the NORTH or EAST cells must be passable.

### Exiting/Entering Sectors through Specific Portals

As previously explained in our [April devlog](TODO), the pathfinder executes a high-level, sector-based
search first before running the more low-level flow field-based routines. The high-level search is
accomplished by building a node graph from the portals connecting the sectors and
then finding a path in said node graph with the A\* algorithm. The reason we do this is to
save computation time by only computing the flow fields for the sectors that the path is going through.

Our initial implementation of the high-level pathfinder needed a few adjustments to work properly.
For example, one assumption was that if both the start and target cell of a path were in the same sector,
they were always reachable from the same sector and thus the high-level search could be skipped. However,
this didn't account for scenarios were start and target were separated by a wall, as seen in the example below:

![Naive grid]()

*A wall separates start (green) and target (orange). The only way to reach the target is to go around through the neighboring sector on the left.*

Another wong assumption was that all portal of a sector can be reached from the start/target cells.
This is obviously not always the case, as you can also see in the example above: The start cell
only has access to the portals in the top left corner of the sector that it's located in. An even
more extreme example would be a start/target cell on an "island", i.e. it location is sorrounded
by impassable cells. If that happens, paths to other sectors obviously can't exist.

![Example ingame island]()

*Ingame example of how such an island could look like. Note that terrain is only one way of creating this situation. Being sorrounded by buildings would have the same effect.*

We are now avoiding these problems by first checking which portals are accessible from the start and
target cells are before starting the high-level pathfinder. To do this, we can simply integrate the
fields for the start and target sectors and then check for each sector portal whether the corresponding
cells in the integration field are passable. Accessible portals in the start sector become the starting
node set for the high-level A\* search, while the accessible portals in the target sector become the
goal nodes. We can even reuse the integration fields for the start and target sector for the low-level
calculations later, since we know that these sectors will be definitely visited. Therefore, these refinements
don't even create that much of an overhead.


### Propagating Line-of-sight through Portals

As described in our [April devlog](TODO), the pathfinder uses line-of-sight (LOS) optimization
to smooth pathing close to the target cell. To put it simply, when a cell on the grid is flagged as LOS,
there exist a direct path from this cell to the target. In practice, this means that game entities can travel
to the target waypoint in a straight line, once the path reaches a cell fagged as LOS.

Previously, LOS computatations stopped at the edges of the target sector. However,
this meant that whenever a path would cross sector boundaries, there was a chance that it
looked noticeable weird. Instead of bee-lining straight towards the target when there are
no obstructions, game entities would first move to the edge of the target sector. This often
looked as if the entities were avoiding invisible obstacles.

![Non-LOS example]()

This behaviour has been fixed by propagating the LOS flags of cells through the portal path.
In essence, the LOS flags from the already integrated (entry) side of a portal are passed through to
the other (exit) side. LOS integration is then run with the LOS flagged portal cells as the starting
point. As a result, paths look much better when they cross multiple sectors:

### Optimizing Field Generation

This topic came up in a Reddit comment before, so we thought it might be interesting to pick it up
again. Performance is also a big factor in the feasibility of flow fields for fast-paced RTS gameplay.
While flow fields can result in overall smoother paths, the added complexity can come with a hefty
performance price tag. Thus, we have to ensure that the pathfinding is as performant as possible to
still work in real game situations.

Over the past months, we have applied several optimization strategies:

**Simplified Code**

We removed a lot of redundant code from the design phase of the pathfinder. This includes things
like redundant sanity checks, debug code, or flags that were only relevant for the pathfinding
demos that you see in our motnhly devlogs.

**CPU-friendly datastructures**

To increase throughput for field generation on the CPU, we replaced most occurences of datastructures
that are known to be slow (e.g. `std::unordered_map`, `std::deque`, `std::unordered_set`) with
vectorized data types (`std::vector` and `std::array`). These data types utilize the CPU's L1-L3 caches
much better, which means that the CPU has to spend less time on fetching data from RAM and has more
time for running calculations.

**Flow Field Caching**

Generated flow fields are now cached and reused for subsequent path requests if possible. The reason
why this works at all is that field generation is deterministic. Choosing the same target cells
used in a previous generation will result in the same flow field. A common scenario where this can
happen is when the target cells are associated with a portal to another sector. Paths that take
the same portal can then also reuse the same flow field.

----

The overall result of our optimizations is that field generation is now about 2x-4x faster than
the first iteration of the pathfinder, even including the enhancements we discussed before. Field
generation is now so fast even that the A\* calculations of the high-level pathfinder take
more time than all low-level pathfinding calculations combined!

## Frustum Culling




## What's next?

- definitly enough pathfinding for now
- we'll continue with something more relaxing
