Title: Stupid Test
Date: 2017-08-12 00:01

This test is totally meaningless as it just is a test.
It contains literally no information. Go away. No reason to continue reading.

``` python
wtf = "You can try as hard as you like, no riddle is hidden here."
print(wtf)
```

As you can see, boring things like code highlighting works.
This is all defined in funny markdown files (may actually not be funny).

``` c++
class TotallyUseless {
    struct its_very_boring {
        int stupid;
        std::string content;
    };

    using yes_even_here = std::vector<its_very_boring>;

public:
    TotallyUseless()
        :
        seriously{
            {13, "it's"},
            {37, "not"},
            {42, "getting"},
            {235, "better"}
        } {

        this->do_nothing();
    }

    const yes_even_here &do_nothing() const {
        return this->seriously;
    }

protected:
    yes_even_here seriously;
};
```


After some extensive suffering, it's also possible to draw tables:

This is | such a table
--------|-------------
it also | contains no content
you may | have guessed this.
but it  | looks pretty.

And because sometimes you have non-code preformatted text,
we have a `<pre>` feature.

<pre>
This allows drawing

I now congratulate you warmly for standing through reading all this nonsense.
