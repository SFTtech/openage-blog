Title: Stupid Test

This test is totally meaningless as it just is a test.
It contains literally no information. Go away. No reason to continue reading.

``` python
wtf = "You can try as hard as you like, no riddle is hidden here."
print(wtf)
```

``` c++
class TotallyUseless {
    struct its_very_boring {
        int stupid;
        std::string content;
    };

    using yes_even_here = std::vector<its_very_boring>;

public:
    TotallyUseless()
        :
        seriously{
            {13, "it's"},
            {37, "not"},
            {42, "getting"},
            {235, "better"}
        } {

        this->do_nothing();
    }

    const yes_even_here &do_nothing() const {
        return this->seriously;
    }

protected:
    yes_even_here seriously;
};
```
